# Applying Deep Learning to Classify Cats and Dogs

*A simple Pytorch implementation to classify cats and dogs after learning from approximately 25,000 images*

After data preprocessing, feed-forward propogation is actiavated. A convolutional neural network is selected due to its high accuracy in analysing 2D images.
The loss and accuracy graphs are shown below:



The cats and dogs image dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)
